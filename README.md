# Ear disease detection using Deep learning

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for the classification of ear diseases from otoscopy images. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model identifies and distinguishes between normal and diseased ear conditions. It is trained on a heterogeneous dataset and evaluated using standard classification metrics.
